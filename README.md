# decompose_insar_velocities
"decompose_insar_velocities" is a set of matlab scripts for performing a velocity decomposition (e.g. REF) on multiple overlapping InSAR velocity fields.
The code has been written to use InSAR LOS velocities generated by LiCSBAS (https://github.com/yumorishita/LiCSBAS), using interferograms from the COMET-LiCS project (https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/COMET-LiCS-portal/), although any LOS velocities may be used if they are correctly formatted as geotifs.

## Processing stages
"decompose_insar_velocities" (DIV) works through the following processing steps, many of which can be altered using within the config file:
1)
2)
3)

## Config file
The example config file provides short descriptions of each option. Below, we give greater details:
